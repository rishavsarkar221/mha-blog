        content: "This fight literally made everyone cry. So All for One is the strongest villain in the My Hero Academia World where 7 One for All users couldn't even put a scratch on him but All Might in his first battle destroyed his head sacrificing his Stomach where half of his respiratory organs were destroyed having the ability to only stay in his muscular form for 3 hrs a day. Then one day again when Bakugo was made hostage by the League of Villains All for One came too and destroyed 2 pro heroes including Best Jeanist the 4th Best Hero. All Might came and was dominated too because he couldn't use his full power because of Bakugo fighting the rest of the villains. Kirishima, Deku, Yaoyorozu, Lida came and helped him get away from them and then the real fight began. All for One dominated All Might and Gran Torino for quite a while until he revealed that Shigaraki was the grand child of Nana Shimura the teacher of All Might who gave him One for All quirk. He was furious and then started beating him but that was of no use as All for One again went and dominated him until everyone started cheering All Might and he used all of his strength to defeat All for One saying goodbye to his quirk. This was surely the best match of all time"

        content: "This was one of the best matches of the entire My Hero Academia Franchise. This resulted in Deku AKA Midoriya badly injure his arm. Even though he was injured he was still giving his best and didn't give up. He convinced Todoroki to use his left side and then in a huge clash between these two's power, Midoriya was fainted and lost the battle. This surely is one of the best matches of the series"

        content: "This was not that type of a match where we would jump from our seats but this was a really awesome match and again showed that Deku is worthy of One for All Power. A very strong villain Muscular was trying to kill Kota a small kid but Deku somehow saved him from his attack. Then Muscular dominated Deku for a while but Deku used his One for All Full Cowling 5% Detroit Smash on him BUT it was of no use. Being dominated for more he used 100% one for all injuring his arms but it didn't damage Muscular that much. Then Muscular tried to kill Deku and Deku used 100% one for all again but it was of no use again. Then Kota used his Water quirk and then Deku somehow got the power and used One for All 1 MILLION PERCENT and finally defeated him. Injuring his arms in the worst way possible he saved a child."

Unfortunately All Might wasn't there at that time so the students and the two pro heroes, Eraser Head and Thirteen had to fight. While Thirteen was taking care of the Warp Gate Aizawa was fighting every other villains all by himself and completely dominating them. Then Aizawa and the mastermind behind the villains Shigaraki came face to face and had a one one one where Shigaraki Decayed Aizawa's elbow and then a Nomu who is almost strong like All Might destroyed him and dominated him."
